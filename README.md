MKtomatoes
==========

MKtomatoes is a Rotten Tomatoes API wrapper written in Java.

This library provides classes and methods to fully access the Rotten Tomatoes API with Java. 
This project is thought in a layered fashion so you can use it at the level you prefer.

What you need to use the library is a Rotten Tomatoes API Key, you can look at the API specification
